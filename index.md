### About Me
- My name is Curtis and I am an electrical engineer by degree and an embedded systems engineer by trade. 
- I love to work in all aspects of embedded design from on-board component selection, PCB design, firmware/OS design, board bring-up, and application development. 
- Although my favorite aspect is when I get to do a board bring up and test the blending of hardware and software functionality. 
- The challenge of having to test my skills in debugging both hardware and software never ceases to bring that sense of pride and accomplishment I think most engineers strive for.
