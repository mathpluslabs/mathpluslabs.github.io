#### Summary<a name="Summary"></a>

My Ender 3 Pro arrived last week and I figured I could give an electrical engineer's persective of assemblying and customizing a 3D printer while being able to provide a great resource for people with zero embedded systems experience; so here you go internet. Recently an opportunity arose where I needed to add a 3D printer to my collection of hardware prototyping tools. I scoured reddit and found that the Ender 3 was a great entry level printer that wouldn't break the bank. So I ended up purchasing an Ender 3 Pro, a SKR v1.4 Turbo w/ TCM2209 stepper motor drivers, a clone of the BMG Extruder, a sprint steel bed with a PEI sheet on it, orange bed springs, and a BLTouch for auto bed leveling.

- [Ender 3 Pro](https://www.creality3d.shop/collections/3d-printer/products/creality3d-ender-3-pro-high-precision-3d-printer?gclid=CjwKCAiA35rxBRAWEiwADqB378nXzYfCuoJeukEVOcnzgog68W4xbVVREYxvGXAWCdHjWzXzKfjy_RoCL7sQAvD_BwE)  
  - I went with the Pro over the basic model becuase I have delt with faulty power supplies in the past and am very familiar with the U.L certification process, so I knew going with the upgraded power supply would be worth the extra investment.

  - SKR v1.4 Turbo: So far it has been a great board. Simple to install and get up and running. Documentation is lacking though. Also there is currently no support in Klipper for this board as they changed the pinout between the v1.3 and this. Debating on whether or not I'm going to dive into the Klipper source and make the changes myself.
  - TMC2209: Absolutely shocked at the volume difference from the stepper motors! Might have to rip open the Mean Well power supply and quite that fan now.
- [BMG Extruder Clone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RBL4CJC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - The BMG extruder (clone) was recommended by quite a few people as a great upgrade and since the stock extruder intake appeared to be a rather fix it now than later component, I opted for the BMG over the metal variant of the stock extruder.
- [Spring Steel Bed w/ PEI](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XBM24HN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - Definitely worth the upgrade! I clean it with isopropel after each print and have yet to have adhesion issues.
- [Stiffer Springs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VFNJ1QS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - Installed immediately and haven't had to level the bed since the first time. Debating on returning the BLTouch since these work so well and my bed appears to not be warped.
- [BLTouch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z1VBBQG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - I have yet to unbox this auto bed leveling device. I'll update this tutorial if I decide to install it.

#### Ender 3 Initial Build<a name="Ender 3 Initial Build"></a>
    
The build was pretty straight forward using the intructions provided by the manufacture.
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/printer/build/1.jpg">
There's really not too much to say about this part of the build, I'm sure there are plenty of tutorials online for anyone who has issues putting the physical hardware together, but I figured I should mention the one issue I ran into.
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/printer/build/2.jpg">
I wanted to make sure the printer was very tight and I found the alluminium pretty soft to the point I completely stripped one of the two holes that connects the x-axis motor bracket to the cross-member.
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/printer/build/3.jpg">
The screw went into the back side of the circled hole. I left is stripped and haven't replaced it with a longer screw that would thread through the other side of the extruded alluminium cross-member, but this is on the todo list for sure.

Other than that, I was able to build the printer, power it up, and start my first build within 1 hour.

#### First Print<a name="First Print"></a>
I chose a baby yoda as my first print using the recommended slicing settings, but completely did not see that I needed to turn on supports, so baby yoda's right hand is pretty jacked but the print came out far above my expectations. 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/printer/first/1.jpg">
It took about 10 hours and 45 minutes on a completely stock Ender 3 Pro... and yes I left my printer running all night on the first print, but I slept next to it and my dog usually barks at fires I start in the house.

#### BMG Bracket<a name="BMG Bracket"></a>
The next evening I looked at all the parts that had arrived and figured the BMG extruder looked like an easy install. After fiddling with the bracket location and not being able to get the extruder to fit properly, I hopped on over to amazon and the reviews mentioned needing a bracket to avoid having to file the extruder, so I printed this bracket.

The stock Ender 3 Pro prints pretty nicely.

 It's fairly easy to install the bracket, I just used some M3 hardware I had laying around from my quadcopter builds.

#### SKR v1.4 Turbo Software<a name="SKR v1.4 Turbo Software"></a>
The software aspect of this project has been very straight forward for me as I am familiar with arduino, C, C++, and VS code. I know that it can be a very daunting task for someone who has not compiled microcontroller firmware before, but if you stick to the instructions and help from reddit and the appropriate githubs you can definitely make it work. I found the BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3 repo and saw there was a folder for Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo. I did some diffs between the `BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3/BTT SKR V1.4/Firmware/Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo/config/default/Configuration.h` and `BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3/BTT SKR V1.4/Firmware/Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo/config/default/Configuration_adv.h` and the `BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3/BTT SKR V1.4/Firmware/Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo/config/examples/Creality/Ender-3/Configuration.h ` and `BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3/BTT SKR V1.4/Firmware/Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo/config/examples/Creality/Ender-3/Configuration_adv.h` files and chose which `#define`'s to keep from the Ender 3 Pro file and the SKR files based on if the parameter seemed associated with a physical component of the Ender 3 Pro or if it appeared to be a controller based parameter. About 30 minutes later I had the basis for the configurations that I'm running right now I type this. I have tweaked a couple of parameters related to speed/acceleration, the BMG extrusion rate, and the SDCard (it would not let me mount it from the LCD so I enabled the SDCard being mounted at all times, which broke the USB interface being available to my PC, but it's been working and I wanted to get it up and running ASAP). I've got my entire configuration available on [my fork the the BIGTREETECH repo](https://github.com/mathpluslabs/BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3). If you have never compiled firmware before, the location of configurations that is actually compiled is at [BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3/BTT SKR V1.4/Firmware/Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo/Marlin/](https://github.com/mathpluslabs/BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3/tree/master/BTT%20SKR%20V1.4/Firmware/Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo/Marlin). I am using the platform.io extenstion within VS code to compile Marlin. Just use the tutorial on the [Marlin github](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html). There documentation needs to be updated though, after cloning the project in step 3, you'll want to go back to the platform.io tab on the left and then the `PIO Home` tab on the top. Then chose `Import Arduino Project`, this will actually enable you to have the `Build` option in the left side bar like their step 4 shows.
