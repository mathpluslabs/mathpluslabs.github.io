#### Summary
My Ender 3 Pro arrived last week and I wanted to make a tutorial on how I got it up and running. Recently an opportunity arose where I needed to add a 3D printer to my collection of hardware prototyping tools. I scoured reddit and found that the Ender 3 was a great entry level printer that wouldn't break the bank. So I ended up purchasing an Ender 3 Pro, a SKR v1.4 turbo ARM based controller board with silent TMC2209 drivers, a BMG extruder, and a BLTouch for auto bed leveling. I went with the Pro over the basic model becuase I have delt with faulty power supplies in the past and am very familiar with the U.L certification process, so I knew going witht the upgraded power supply would be worth the extra investment. I haven't attempted to get the BLTouch functional yet as after more research I found this might not be an upgrade worthy of the cost. The BMG extruder (clone) was recommended by quite a few people as a great upgrade and since the stock extruder intake appeared to be a rather fix it now than later component, I opted for the BMG over the metal variant of the stock extruder. As for the SKR v1.4 turbo, I initially ran the printer and considering it will be running very frequently, I desired a way to silence this beast. The TMC2209 drivers were a new variant of the beloved TMC2208 drivers so I figured I would go that route. One aspect of this build I was not anticipating was the SRK v1.4 turbo was recently released and there is not much documentation on it other than the far from complete documentation avaliable from the manufacture. So this is how I got the point of making this tutorial. I figured I could give an electrical engineer's persective of assemblying and customizing a 3D printer while being able to provide a great resource for people with zero embedded systems experience.

#### Ender 3 Initial Build
The build was pretty straight forward using the intructions provided by the manufacture. There's really not too much to say about this part of the build, I'm sure there are plenty of tutorials online for anyone who has issues putting the physical hardware together, but I figured I should mention the one issue I ran into. I wanted to make sure the printer was very tight and I found the alluminium pretty soft to the point I completely stripped one of the two holes that connects the x-axis motor bracket to the cross-member. I left is stripped and haven't replaced it with a longer screw that would thread through the other side of the extruded alluminium cross-member, but this is on the todo list for sure. Other than that, I was able to build the printer, power it up, and start my first build within 1 hour.

#### First Print
I chose a baby yoda as my first print using the recommended slicing settings, but completely did not see that I needed to turn on supports, so baby yoda's right hand is pretty jacked but the print came out far above my expectations. 
It took about 10 hours and 45 minutes on a completely stock Ender 3 Pro.

#### BMG Bracket
Amazon parts began to arrive and my BMG extruder ended up arriving! The reviews mentioned needing a bracket to avoid having to file the extruder, so I printed this bracket and installed it using some M3 hardware I had laying around. The bracket turned out great, but I was really wanting to speed this thing up. Initially I planned to run the printer stock but with klipper and test the difference between stock and klipper, but since my SKR would be delivered tomorrow I opted to let it sit for the evening and pick up where I left of tomorrow after installing the BMG.

#### SKR v1.4 Turbo Software
The software aspect of this project has been very straight forward for me as I am familiar with arduino, C, C++, and VS code. I know that it can be a very daunting task for someone who has not compiled microcontroller firmware before, but if you stick to the instructions and help from reddit and the appropriate githubs you can definitely make it work. I found the BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3 repo and saw there was a folder for Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo. I did some diffs between the `BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3/BTT SKR V1.4/Firmware/Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo/config/default/Configuration.h` and `BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3/BTT SKR V1.4/Firmware/Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo/config/default/Configuration_adv.h` and the `BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3/BTT SKR V1.4/Firmware/Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo/config/examples/Creality/Ender-3/Configuration.h ` and `BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3/BTT SKR V1.4/Firmware/Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo/config/examples/Creality/Ender-3/Configuration_adv.h` files and chose which `#define`'s to keep from the Ender 3 Pro file and the SKR files based on if the parameter seemed associated with a physical component of the Ender 3 Pro or if it appeared to be a controller based parameter. About 30 minutes later I had the basis for the configurations that I'm running right now I type this. I have tweaked a couple of parameters related to speed/acceleration, the BMG extrusion rate, and the SDCard (it would not let me mount it from the LCD so I enabled the SDCard being mounted at all times, which broke the USB interface being available to my PC, but it's been working and I wanted to get it up and running ASAP). I've got my entire configuration available on [my fork the the BIGTREETECH repo](https://github.com/mathpluslabs/BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3). If you have never compiled firmware before, the location of configurations that is actually compiled is at [BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3/BTT SKR V1.4/Firmware/Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo/Marlin/](https://github.com/mathpluslabs/BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1.3/tree/master/BTT%20SKR%20V1.4/Firmware/Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-V1.4-Turbo/Marlin). I am using the platform.io extenstion within VS code to compile Marlin. Just use the tutorial on the (Marlin github)[https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html]. There documentation needs to be updated though, after cloning the project in step 3, you'll want to go back to the platform.io tab on the left and then the `PIO Home` tab on the top. Then chose `Import Arduino Project`, this will actually enable you to have the `Build` option in the left side bar like their step 4 shows.
